        <p>
          Graphic Designer actually in training at the Wild Code School in full
          remote and currently on the path of becoming a fullstack javascript
          web developer in Bordeaux France.

        <p>
          After several years spent as a graphic designer in France and Canada
          and with already some rudiment in HTML and CSS, I decided to go a step
          further and to become a web developer full stack. I really enjoy
          learning new things and coding even though quite challenging and
          sometimes upsetting (looking at you syntax) it is such a joy when you
          find the solution and everything goes finally the way you intend it to
          be.
