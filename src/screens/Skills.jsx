        <p>
          Since the start of my web developer journey a few months ago I've been
          improving steadily. It all started in June when my team mate and
          myself received our first project assignment at la Wild Code School.
          Creating a responsive website in HTML & CSS using GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our second project was to create a mobile first website to look up
          cocktail recipes from an existing API in full React.js and Material
          UI. For this occasion we started using Agile methods with user stories
          and MVP implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we participated in a two days Hackathon, and to chill a bit we
          decided to develop a tacky interstellar meetup website for all star
          wars characters to use freely. We used tailwind for the CSS and
          localhost to mimic an account for the back-end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our third project was to create a full stack website for a real
          client. The brief stated to develop a website fully manageable with
          templates via an administrator interface like a CMS. We used React.js,
          Node.js, Express, MySQL for the database...
        </p>
        <p>
          During the last project we had a three day Hackathon challenge in
          which we had to develop a mini game with Unity and C#.
